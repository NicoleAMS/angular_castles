It was built between 1284 and 1293 by Bishop Burnell, Edward I's Lord Chancellor, and Parliaments were held here twice, in 1283 and 1285. By 1420, the castle was abandoned, and it was allowed to decay while a new house, Acton Burnell Hall, was built beside it. Nonetheless, the castle remains an impressive example of a medieval fortified manor house.",
